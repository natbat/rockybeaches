    Point Fermin is an expansive intertidal area with sloping reefs and uplifted benches.

    This site is located on the eastern portion of Cabrillo Beach Park in San Pedro, Los Angeles County. The site is accessed from the Beach Park and Cabrillo Marine Aquarium parking lot. You will have to either pay for parking or park outside the gates on the street. The study site is ahead and to the right about 300 m below the cliffs as you are standing in the parking lot facing south toward the ocean. Walk along the path across the grass until you access the boardwalk at the base of the cliffs. When the board walk ends, proceed along the intertidal to the concrete bunker foundations.

    The parking lot is right off Highway 1 about three miles north of the Pigeon Point
    Lighthouse. At the parking lot above the beach there are picnic tables with barbeques
    and restrooms nearby. Arroyo del los Frijoles cove has a sandy beach with some
    rocks near the center and two rocky points closing off the cove a bit from the
    ocean. This shape of the cove creates a strong rip current so swimming is dangerous
    here. The creek in Arroyo de los Frijoles flows down to Lake Lucerne Reservoir
    next to Highway 1 and then hits the beach south of the parking lot entrance. There
    is a self-guided nature trail that begins at the north part of the beach and follows
    the bluff between the highway and the ocean all the way to Pebble Beach which
    is the northern beach of Bean Hollow State Beach. This trail is about one-mile
    each way making it an easy round-trip from either beach

    <p>As tide pools go, this is pretty accessible. It's a bit of a walk on the flat path and there is a bit of beach to navigate to get to the pools, but the pools also have a reasonably flat section. That said, there are some fast flowing cut-throughs to get over if you want to go further out and seasonally some quite slippery seaweed, so a walking stick makes a good companion.</p>

    <p>The edge of the tide pools nearest to the open ocean on the furthest right hand side (if you are facing out to sea) can be heavily affected by wind and swell, so as always, keep an eye out on the ocean, particularly so if it looks choppy.</p>

    <p>If you go far out, make sure to watch your exit route to ensure that you don&#x27;t get cut off by the incoming tide.</p>

    <p>If you are setting up a picnic don&#x27;t sit too near to the base of the cliff because erosion can cause dangerous falling rocks.</p>

    County. This is a small cove with a pebbly coarse brown sand. A stair leads down
    from the small circular parking area to the rocky south end of the cove. Excellent
    tide pools can be found in the rocks at the south end. Be careful on these rocks
    as sneaker waves (waves that are larger than normal) can come crashing ashore.This
    location is also known for tafoni rocks which are uniquely textured sandstone
    with holes and honeycomb-like structures that have been created through a weathering
    process. A self-guided nature trail can be found at the circular end of the Pebble
    Beach access road. This hiking trail continues along the bluff between Highway
    1 and the rocky shoreline for about a mile to Arroyo de los Frijoles Beach, the
    southern beach in Bean Hollow State Beach.

    \nThis state park is loaded with nooks and crannies full of marine life. Weston\
    \ Beach is the largest and best known of the beaches at Point Lobos.\n\nAn area\
    \ called Weston Beach is the best place to visit tide pools at Point Lobos State\
    \ Reserve. The tide pools at Point Lobos are only visible at certain times, depending\
    \ on the season and tide schedule. Some areas only visible during a season or\
    \ two while others exposed for viewing multiple times a day. The critters most\
    \ often exposed for viewing include hermit crabs, different species of algae,\
    \ anemones, and snails. The less frequently visible inhabitants include bat stars,\
    \ sea urchins, and squishy looking things called \u201Cnudibranchs,\u201D which\
    \ are only visible during seasons of very low tides. If you\u2019re determined\
    \ to see your very first nudibranch, plan your visit to coincide with the lowest\
    \ tides of the year.\n\nHiking, wildflowers and sea life galore are the features\
    \ of this picturesque area of Carmel. The best spot to check out the tide pools\
    \ is on Weston Beach, just south and west of the main entrance. If you are lucky\
    \ you may even spot a sea lion or otter frolicking in the waves. Volunteer docents\
    \ are available to answer questions at the Sea Lion Point parking lot most days\
    \ from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m."

    \ If you are lucky, you might see some!\n\nHowever, unlike Soquel Avenue, the\
    \ Opal Cliffs site did not appear to be affected by the county\u2019s sewage discharge\
