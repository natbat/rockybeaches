    <p>As tide pools go, this is pretty accessible. It's a bit of a walk on the flat path and there is a bit of beach to navigate to get to the pools, but the pools also have a reasonably flat section. That said, there are some fast flowing cut-throughs to get over if you want to go further out and seasonally some quite slippery seaweed, so a walking stick makes a good companion.</p>

    <p>The edge of the tide pools nearest to the open ocean on the furthest right hand side (if you are facing out to sea) can be heavily affected by wind and swell, so as always, keep an eye out on the ocean, particularly so if it looks choppy.</p>

    <p>If you go far out, make sure to watch your exit route to ensure that you don&#x27;t get cut off by the incoming tide.</p>

    <p>If you are setting up a picnic don&#x27;t sit too near to the base of the cliff because erosion can cause dangerous falling rocks.</p>

  body: Pebble Beach is the northern beach in Bean Hollow State Beach in San Mateo
    County. This is a small cove with a pebbly coarse brown sand. A stair leads down
    from the small circular parking area to the rocky south end of the cove. Excellent
    tide pools can be found in the rocks at the south end. Be careful on these rocks
    as sneaker waves (waves that are larger than normal) can come crashing ashore.This
    location is also known for tafoni rocks which are uniquely textured sandstone
    with holes and honeycomb-like structures that have been created through a weathering
    process. A self-guided nature trail can be found at the circular end of the Pebble
    Beach access road. This hiking trail continues along the bluff between Highway
    1 and the rocky shoreline for about a mile to Arroyo de los Frijoles Beach, the
    southern beach in Bean Hollow State Beach.
