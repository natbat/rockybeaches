    <p>Pillar Point is awesome</p>
  accessibility_and_safety: |-
    <p>As tide pools go, this is pretty accessible, it's a bit of a walk on the flat path and there is a bit of beach to navigate to get to the pools, but the pools also have a reasonable flat section. That said, there are some fast flowing cut-throughs to get over if you want to go further out and seasonally some quite slippery seaweed, so a walking stick makes a good companion.</p><p>The edge of the tide pools nearest to the open ocean on the furthest right hand side (if you are facing out to sea) can be heavily affected by wind and swell, so as always, keep an eye out on the ocean, particularly so if it looks choppy.</p><p>If you go far out, make sure to watch your exit route to ensure that you don&#x27;t get cut off by the incoming tide.</p><p>If you are setting up a picnic don&#x27;t sit too near to the base of the Cliff because erosion can cause dangerous falling rocks.</p>"
  directions: |-
    <p>Park in the parking lot at the bottom of the radar station if possible, follow the trail at the sea-end of the carpark straight out and along as the path swings to the right around the bluff. The tide pools, shallow-water kelp beds and a secluded beach are about half a mile or so from the carpark after you pass the Jetty on the left.</p><p>Keep an eye out for Shorebirds in the marsh to the left, Harbor Seals in the secluded harbor before the Jetty and nesting Great Blue Herons in the trees on the walk to the tide pools.</p>
