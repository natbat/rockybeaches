    <p>Pillar Point is awesome! there is a lot of variety in the types of pool
    left by the tide. The left hand side (looking out to sea) has some small
    pocket pools and a wide flat seagrass bed. there are lots of accessible
    little pools near the beach and there's a small cut parallel to the beach
    which is a good place to spot fish.</p>
    <p>The pools along the deeper ravine at a 90% angle to the beach have giant
    green anemones, acorn barnacles and is where you'll want to head to find
    nudibranchs. There are some sea palms and varied fauna on the rocks next to
    this ravine also.</p>
    <p>This area is a popular surfing spot, also known as Mavericks when the
    tide is high and the waves can come in fast and strong so you'll need to
    watch your back and don't underestimate the tide. The smaller cut parallel
    to the beach fills in first so do wear water shoes!</p>
  accessibility_and_safety: |-
    <p>As tide pools go, this is pretty accessible. It's a bit of a walk on the
    flat path and there is a bit of beach to navigate to get to the pools, but
    the pools also have a reasonably flat section. That said, there are some
    fast flowing cut-throughs to get over if you want to go further out and
    seasonally some quite slippery seaweed, so a walking stick makes a good
    companion.</p>
    <p>The edge of the tide pools nearest to the open ocean on the
    furthest right hand side (if you are facing out to sea) can be heavily
    affected by wind and swell, so as always, keep an eye out on the ocean,
    particularly so if it looks choppy.
    </p>
    <p>If you go far out, make sure to watch your exit route to ensure that
    you don&#x27;t get cut off by the incoming tide.</p>
    <p>If you are setting up a picnic don&#x27;t sit too near
    to the base of the cliff because erosion can cause dangerous falling rocks.</p>
  directions: |-
    <p>Park in the parking lot at the bottom of the radar station if possible,
    follow the trail at the sea-end of the carpark straight out and along as
    the path swings to the right around the bluff. The tide pools, shallow-water
    sea grass beds and a secluded beach are about half a mile or so from the carpark
    after you pass the jetty on the left.</p><p>Keep an eye out for shorebirds
    in the marsh to the left, harbor seals in the secluded harbor before the
    jetty and nesting great blue herons in the trees on the walk to the tide
    pools.</p>
